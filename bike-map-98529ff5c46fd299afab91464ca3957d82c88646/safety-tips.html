            <div class="one">
                Always wear a helmet!
                <p class="description">
                    Statistics show that only 17% of bicycle related fatalities occured with people wearing helmets
                    while
                    54% occured without a helmet

            <div class="two">
                Always follow the rules of the road!
                <p class="description">
                    Cyclists are considered a vehicle on the road and follow all traffic laws. They are expected to
                    behave like
                    motor vehicles, stop at stop signs and red lights.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="three">
                Be predictable!
                <p class="description">
                    Always follow the flow of traffic, motor vehicle drivers are not always expecting cyclists on the
                    road.
                    When unexpected, motor vehicles may intersect with your path and cause a crash.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="four">
                Always be visible!
                <p class="description">
                    Sometimes it may be hard for drivers to spot bikes on the road. This is especially true at night.
                    Wear bright
                    /neon colors so that you are more visible. Having reflective strips and lights on your bike help a
                    lot as well.

            </div>
            <div class = "five">
                Look before turning!
                <p class ="description">
                    when turning left or right, always look behind you for a break in traffic, 
                    then signal before making the turn. Watch for left- or right-turning traffic.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "six">
                Yield to Traffic when appropriate!
                <p class = "description">
                    drivers on a smaller road must yield (wait) for traffic on a major or larger road. 
                    If there is no stop sign or traffic signal and you are coming from a smaller roadway , 
                    you must slow down and look to see if the way is clear before proceeding.
